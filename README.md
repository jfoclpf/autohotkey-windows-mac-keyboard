This [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) configuration file makes usual keyboard shortcuts work with an Apple keyboard on Windows. It has been amended to be suited for Portuguese from Portugal.

If it's not working for applications running with admin permissions, it might be the problem that AHK is not, see [this question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8457852/723769).

Installation
------------

- Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) 
- Run the `MacKeyboard.ahk` file (save the file as UTF8 with BOM)
- Put the `MacKeyboard.ahk` file or a shortcut to the file in your Autostart folder to run it automatically on startup.
